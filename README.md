# Assignment2

This is an app that translate the English language to American sign language

## Usage
You can use the website through this URL: https://assignment2-psi.vercel.app/login 

Enter a username to be navigated to the translation page. From the translation page you can enter English phrases, and it will be translated to American sign language. Our website supports only English characters, no Scandinavian chars, Cyrillic or other, sadly.  

## Known bugs
- If your first login is with a new user, the app will not automatically navigate to the Translation Page after this first submission. (It will for subsequent logins.)
