This is an app that translate the English language to sign language

## Installation
Use NPM to install the necessary libraries to

```bash
npm install```

## Usage

Open the application with npm start, enter a username to be navigated towards the translation page. From the translation page you can enter English phrases and it will be translated to Sign. Only got support for English characters, no Scandinavian chars, Cyrillic or other sadly.  

```bash
npm start```

Open the application with npm start, enter a username and learn sign language.

```

## Known bugs
- If your first login is with a new user, the app will not automatically navigate to the Translation Page after this first submission. (It will for subsequent logins.)
