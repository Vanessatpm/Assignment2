# Assignment2

This is an app that translate from English language to American sign language.

## Usage
You can use the website through this URL: https://assignment2-psi.vercel.app/login. From the **login page**, enter a username to be navigated to the translation page. From the **translation page** you can enter English phrases, and it will be translated to American sign language. Our website supports only English characters, no Scandinavian chars, Cyrillic or other, sadly. On the **profile page** you can see your last 10 translations, and log out.

## Known bugs
- If your first login is with a new user, the app will not automatically navigate to the Translation Page after this first submission. (It will for subsequent logins.)
